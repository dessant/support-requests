## Description

Support Requests is a specialized version of

and it can perform the following actions when an issue
is labeled, unlabeled or reopened:

- The support label is added: leave a comment, close and lock the issue
- The support label is removed: reopen and unlock the issue
- The issue is reopened: remove the support label, unlock the issue

          support-label: 'support'
          issue-comment: >
            :wave: @{issue-author}, we use the issue tracker exclusively
            for bug reports and feature requests. However, this issue appears

          lock-issue: false
          issue-lock-reason: 'off-topic'
```

### Using a personal access token

The action uses an installation access token by default to interact with GitHub.
You may also authenticate with a personal access token to perform actions
as a GitHub user instead of the `github-actions` app.

Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with the `repo` or `public_repo` scopes enabled, and add the token as an
[encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository)
for the repository or organization, then provide the action with the secret
using the `github-token` input parameter.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: dessant/support-requests@v3
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```
